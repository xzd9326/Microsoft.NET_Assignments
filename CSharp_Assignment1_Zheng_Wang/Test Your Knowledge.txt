---------------------------------------Understanding Data Types--------------------------------------------
1.What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
A person’s telephone number													string	
A person’s height															short (in centimeters)
A person’s age																byte
A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer)						Enum
A person’s salary															uint or int
A book’s ISBN																string
A book’s price																ushort
A book’s shipping weight													byte (in pounds)
A country’s population														uint
The number of stars in the universe											double
The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the	ushort
United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business)


2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?
	Value types directly contain their data, while reference types store references to their data (objects).
	Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type.
	Unboxing extracts the value type from the object.

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
	Managed resources are those that are managed by the CLR.
	Unmanaged resources mean native resources that are created and lifetime managed outside the CLR, such as database connections.

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
	.NET's garbage collector manages the allocation and release of memory for the application. It can free memory when needed.

----------------------------------------Controlling Flow and Converting Types----------------------------------------------------
1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
	The program will throw a DividByZeroException

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
	The program will return Infinity / negative infinity / NAN

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
	It wraps around from max value to min value and keep going

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
	x = y++ assign x with the value of y first, then the value of y increment by 1;
	x = ++y increment the value of y by 1 first, then assign its value to x

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
	break: terminates the closest enclosing iteration or switch statement.
	continue: starts a new iteration of the closest enclosing iteration.
	return: terminates execution of the function in which it appears and returns control to the caller.
