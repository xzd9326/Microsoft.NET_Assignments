1. Describe the problem generics address.
	Generics solves the problem of having to use loosely typed objects, thus allow us to define type-safe data structures.

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
	List<string> myStr = new List<string>(); 

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
	2, Tkey and Tvalue

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
	True

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
	lst.Add();

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
	RemoveAt() and Remove()

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
	A generic type parameter is declared in an angle brackets after a type name.

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
	False

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
	True

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
	True
